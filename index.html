        Ayo, this song is dedicated <br>
        To all the happy people<br>
        All the happy people who have real nice lives <br>
        And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck <br>
<br> 
        <span class="divisions">[Verse 1]</span> <br>
        I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net<br>
        Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck<br>
        I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check<br>
        I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt<br>
        Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged<br>
        Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged<br>
        And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper<br>
        I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer<br>
        Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders<br>
        These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers<br>
        We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us<br>
        Along with the small fries and average half-pinters<br>
        But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas<br>
        'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us<br>
        Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
        <br> Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless <br> 
<br>
        <span class="divisions">[Chorus]</span>
        <br>
        That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill<br>
        That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal<br>
        That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here<br>
        'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear<br>
        That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill<br>
        That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal<br>
        That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here<br>
        'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear<br>
<br>
        <span class="divisions">[Verse 2]</span> <br>
        My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams<br>
        I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings<br>
        I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished<br>
        Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished<br>
        And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay<br>
        And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day<br>
        But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play<br>
        'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way<br>
        'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan<br>
        When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan<br>
        Or comfortable and roomy in a 6<br>
        But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics<br>
        Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day<br>
        And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today<br>
        My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play<br>
        Live half my life and throw the rest away<br>
<br>

<span class="divisions">[Chorus]</span>
<br>
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill<br>
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal<br>
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here<br>
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear<br>
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill<br>
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal<br>
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here<br>
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear<br>
<br>

<br>
There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup) <br>
But it's the evil that made me <br>
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm) <br>
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame <br>
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame <br>
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name <br>
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain <br>
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom <br>
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh) <br>
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em <br>
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em <br>
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em <br>
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em <br>
And while you flaunt 'em <br>
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em <br>
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em? <br>
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song <br>
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn <br>
<br>
